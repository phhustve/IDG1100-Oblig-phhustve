    <ul>
        <li> A processing unit, this is to contain both data and instructions in binary form</li>
        <li> A control unit, this unit could perform mathematic and logic operations</li>
        <li>  Memory, where it stores data and instructions</li>

    <h3>24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at” +
        DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on today’s date (only today).</h3>

            <p>1. Start by finding the parameters to put in your cronjob, this can be done using this command: </p>
            <pre><code>echo "*/30 * $(date +%d) $(date +%m)"</code></pre>
    
            <p>2. Open your crontab using this command: </p>
            <pre><code>crontab -e</code></pre>

            <p>3. Type in the paramaters you found in step one. Then type in the message you want to print. Like this: </p>
            <pre><code>echo "task scheduled at" $(date)</code></pre>
            <p>In the the crontab it should look like this, but with different parameters depending on the date.</p>
            <pre><code>*/30 * 20 11 * echo "Task scheduled at $(date)"</code></pre>

    <h3>25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
        The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be
        chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of
        the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
        the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
        changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
        menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
    
        <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
